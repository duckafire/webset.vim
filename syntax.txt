CONCEPT

	Identifiers scope always must be explicited
during their declaration (except to function
arguments), and use - run `:h internal-variables`.

	Only the strictly necessary 'things' can
be global (`g:`). They must be declared in
the indentation level zero - no-global things
declared in that level must be putted in
the script scope (`s:`).

	Identifiers must not be declared inside loops;
functions must not declared inside other functions.

	`v:null` must be used to representate "no-started
variables".

	`v:false` and `v:true` must be used as boolean
values.

	Comparations with `v:null` must be explicit
(`l:foo == v:null`).

	Case-sensitive support must be explicit during
comparation between strings (query `:h expr-==#`).
